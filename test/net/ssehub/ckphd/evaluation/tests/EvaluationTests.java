     * 
     * Construction tests with: Evaluation(File repositoryArchiveFile, File commitSequenceDirectory)
     * Where any combination of null, non-existing file, directory and/of file as parameter should be tested
     * 
     * Execution tests with: run(String hookActions)
     * Where the different combination of hook actions (as in RepositoryTests) should be tested
     * 
     * Further, we need something like a "ScenarioTest", where a full sequence of commits is applied iteratively and
     * the hook actions enable the tests to check, whether the correct commit in the correct order are applied.
